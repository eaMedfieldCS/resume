<h3>
Objective
</h3>
<p>
As a sophmore in high school, my goal for this year is to advance my 
skills and improve myself to the highest level possible. I am currently working hard to balance 
school as well as extracurricular activities, such as cross-country, track, and theater.
</p><hr/>
<p>
<strong>Running:</strong><br>
I have been a runner for the past two years. Running as part of a team has increased my ability 
to work in small teams, as well as cooperate in an organization larger than myself. Running cross 
country and in track has helped me learn time management and dedication.
</p><hr/>
<p>
<strong>Theater:</strong><br>
This year, I joined theater. As a member of the theater or 'drama' group, we learn to collaborate 
and raise our skills as actors, dancers, and singers. It has allowed for amazing presentations and 
group performances.
</p><hr/>
<p><strong>A5:</strong><br>
A5 is an ambassador's program, representing Amelia's Light at the high school. 
As a member of the group, I have been able to volunteer to raise awareness against sex trafficking.</p><hr/>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br>
It is important to have as many strengths as possible in many different areas, but not so spread out that the strengths 
become insignificant. I pride myself on working great in teams, and being a team leader. I am extremely hardworking and 
dedicated to the current task at hand, always. I always think outside the box to solve problems, and communicate well 
with peers.</p><hr/>
<p><strong>Photographer:</strong><br>
I pride myself on my dedication as a photographer, and enjoy taking photos of nature when Iâ€™m not focusing on sports or school.</p>
